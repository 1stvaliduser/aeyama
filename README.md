Welcome to a great new world, you are a ground robot that just discovered a new planet that is rich in ressources, your objective is to colonize it, to rediscover the technologies from the past using basic materials to maybe one day, finally have your own little planet. . .

This mod is still in development, and it's not playable for now. If you have any question join our [Discord].

### Plans

In the next update, you will have acces to a brand new planet, with some basic ressources and technologies.

In future updates we planned on adding more sectors, french translation, more blocks and more technologies and new sectors.
